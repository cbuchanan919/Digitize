## Welcome to Chris Buchanan's Digitize repo
### General Setup Info:
My laptop is running Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS and it has arduino version 1.8.19 installed. I'm using picocom to connect to arduino via serial, and using vim as the text editor. Somehow, Doxygen will be used to maintain a working documentation of the code. Git & github (https://github.com/cbuchanan919/Digitize) are being used to source control my code.

### Notes:
Getting arduino installed & the IDE talking to the arduino board was relatively easy. Getting the makefile installed & configured properly was very challenging for me. I had to configure the ~/.bashrc file to add the necessary make paths, google error messages, and add the include arduino.h in the main file, (etc).
