Project 1 will have you set up your project laptop and Arduino development environment, as well as begin on the core of your RTU -\/ a command line interpreter. You will be required to take in a string from the keyboard, parse it, and execute different functions based on the contents. In addition to the laptop and Arduino board, you will also be given a bi-\/color LED to control.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{RTU Application overview\+:}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The thousand foot view is that the program interprets commands and implements them. Currently, it can control led\textquotesingle{}s and show information through the serial connection. It does this by continuously looping and checking for input, then controling the led\textquotesingle{}s. If input is entered, it will print the character back to screen. If return is pressed, it will send the command off to be processed. If there\textquotesingle{}s no input to process, it will continue on to perform the blink function.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{General Setup Info\+:}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
My laptop is running Ubuntu 22.\+04.\+1 LTS and it has arduino version 1.\+8.\+19 installed. I\textquotesingle{}m using picocom to connect to arduino via serial, and using vim as the text editor. Doxygen is used to maintain a working documentation of the code. Git \& github (\href{https://github.com/cbuchanan919/Digitize}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/cbuchanan919/\+Digitize}}) are being used to source control my code.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{Notes\+:}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
Getting arduino installed \& the IDE talking to the arduino board was relatively easy. Getting the makefile installed \& configured properly was very challenging for me. I had to configure the $\sim$/.bashrc file to add the necessary make paths, google error messages, and add the include arduino.\+h in the main file, (etc).
